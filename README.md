InboxAction is an early‑access productivity tool that connects to your Gmail, scans for real tasks hiding inside your inbox, and turns them into a clean actionable list — automatically.

This repo contains the landing page, waitlist system, and an early backend API for capturing and managing waitlist signups using Vercel + Upstash Redis, along with a working action‑suggestion endpoint that converts text into suggested actions (Approve, Schedule, Extract).
